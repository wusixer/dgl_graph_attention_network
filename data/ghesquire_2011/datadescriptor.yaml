  overview: |
    This dataset provides 2626 rows of measurements of
    methionines that have had their methionines oxidized.
  fields:
    - name: accession
      title: UniProt accession number
      type: string
      format: default
      description: |
        UniProt accession number.

        Given the age of the paper, this accession number might be outdated.
        If so, check the "isoforms" column for alternative accesion numbers
        that contain the sequence as spelled out in the "sequence" column.

    - name: Description
      title: Name of the protein.
      type: string
      format: default
      description: |
        Full length name of the protein.

    - name: sequence
      title: Protein fragment sequence that contains a methionine residue.
      type: string
      format: default
      description: |
        Each of these protein fragments was detected,
        in the original LC/MS experiment that generated the raw data,
        to have some degree of oxidation,
        recorded in the "%ox_fwd" column.

    - name: isoforms
      title: Other proteins, or isoforms of the same protein.
      type: string
      format: default
      description: |
        This column lists out other proteins and/or isoforms of the same protein
        that contain the same "sequence" string inside it.

    - name: end
      title: Position on protein keyed by "accession" of last amino acid in "sequence"
      type: integer
      format: null
      description: |
        The integer in this column is the 1-indexed position of the last letter of the "sequence" entry
        inside the full-length protein sequence keyed by the "accession" field.

    - name: score

    - name: "%ox_fwd"
      title: Percentage of methionines oxidized.
      type: number
      format: null
      description: |
        This is the target column to try to predict from sequence.

        The mass spec measurements reveal the percentage of oxidized methionines
        by measuring the percentage of mass charge ratios
        that indicate change in mass due to the oxidation process.

        It being a 0-100 value (effectively a 0-1 value),
        a neural-network-friendly modelling method
        would be to predict its logits value (i.e. log(p/(1-p))),
        which is unbounded.

    - name: "%ox_rev"
      title: TBD
      format: null
      description: |
        Percentage of methionines oxidized in the "reverse" direction.

        How this is measured and defined requires looking at the original paper.
