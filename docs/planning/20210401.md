## Present

- Kannan Sankar
- Jiayi Cox
- Mei Xiao


## Things done

- added ANM and NMA descriptors and generated ANM.pkl and NMA.pkl files
- ran the bench.ipynb notebook to see the updated descirptors performance (results waiting to be updated)

# To do:
- Jiayi : update the new function docstring, understand bench.ipynb, and share the updated descriptor results to the team
- Mei: try to fix the easy data store, try making it a package and push to artifactory (https://repo.nibr.novartis.net/artifactory/webapp/#/home, contains many packages). Use python script to download based on Kannan's new upload
- Kannan: Put new descriptors to data store. Look into the data points to see if we can identify problmatic ones to help improve the model perfermance.

## Future work

Try all models with the new descriptors (ANM and NMA)
Summarize what has been done (make graph and performance metrics)
