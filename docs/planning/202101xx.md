## Agenda

1. How we are going to perform machine learning model benchmarking.

## Proposed strategy

### Models

- Train patch-GNN model on either homology model or crystal structure data.
- Specific models to try building
  - one-hot + random forest
  - unirep default weights + random forest
  - unirep default weights + top feed-forward end-to-end model
  - patch-gnn from random weights
  - patch-gnn with weights pre-trained on a small collection of structures

### Data cleaning

Key questions:

- What serves as "inclusion criteria" for a sequence?
  - Its full-length sequence is available
  - Its structure is available, or a good quality homology model can be made.

This way, we should be able to keep the datasets constant between the models.
