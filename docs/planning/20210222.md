- Eric Ma
- Kannan Sankar
- Mei Xiao

## Things done

1. Bench mark of four models: one hot encoding random forest, unirep encoding random forest, MPNN, DEEPMPNN
2. Best model on test set order is MPNN, DEEPMPNN, UniRep RF, One Hot RF
3. Train set: 102
4. Test set: 45

## To Do

1. Put easy-datastore to artifactory from Mei
2. Full set of models from Kannan
