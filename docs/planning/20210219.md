## Things done

1. EM added a notebook - tried out UniRep model + random forest. Performance was horrible.
2. KS and EM explored the 3D structure of methionines that were part of highly and lowly oxidizing sequences.
3. Finally rounded off with a chart that shows met node degree negatively correlated with oxidization.
