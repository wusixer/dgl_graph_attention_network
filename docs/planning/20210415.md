## Present

- Kannan Sankar
- Jiayi Cox
- Mei Xiao


## Things done
- revisted bench.ipynb
- made a fluc_xx.ipynb looking at linear regression performance using ANM and NMA
- added ANM and NMA to graphs.pkl 

# To do:
- Jiayi : run make file to update graphs.pkl. update graph_tensor to add ANM and NMA to descriptor list. Add test code of seqops `one_hot` function. Try work on LSTM code more. Tune bench.ipynb parameters. Make layers input values more flexible. 

- Mei: follow up with data_store, try finding areas in terms of software engineering to make improvments. Make code protable. 

## Future work
Kannan will model Asp and Asn datasets.
