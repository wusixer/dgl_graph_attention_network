# Planning notes

Next steps:

1. [ ] Check-in on "actual" data -- kannan?
1. [ ] Defining some dummy tasks by brainstorming.

## Notes

### Actual Learning Tasks

We were interested in liability prediction.
Do this data exist?

Made some progress with data. Two aspects.

1. Need proteins + annotations.
    1. For liabilities: doing methionine liabilities.
    1. Have external datasets - not necessarily antibodies. Have lots of data points, in the thousands. Problem: fewer methionines are oxidizing than not. This will be imbalanced.
        1. This dataset has not been processed just yet.
    1. Another dataset of 137 antibody proteins from AdiMab. This has been processed.
    1. Internal datasets are being worked on.
    1. Looked through inventory, Kannan did a seq. analysis to figure out which ones are unique, which are "interesting". These still need to be experimentally measured.
    1. Stress testing will happen in February, likely in Spring.
1. Could try existing models --> from Kannan's previous life!
    1. Kannan previously built a model based on structure (e.g. solvent exposure, etc.) to predict liability from structure. Kannan could try using this model to prioritize.
    1. Main problem: when certain met was located in CDR H3, problems arose. Loop modelling is unreliable.

### Pre-text learning tasks

Ideas that we had before:

1. Predict graph theoretic properties of a node.
    1. Number of neighbors/degree centrality
1. Predict amino acid identity after being masked out.
1. Pretext-tasks (at the residue level)
    1. Secondary structure. annotate each residue as being part of a beta sheet, alpha helix, loop, turn etc.
    1. Predict if an amino acid is in a trans-membrane region or not.
1. Possible whole protein tasks:
    1. SCOP class: whether it is rich in alpha helix, beta sheets, or mix.
    1. Classify is-transmembrane or not?
    1. Cellular location (by signal peptide)
    1. Gene ontology (GO) term: function/localization/biological process

## Other notes

From Mei: Joni Lam had some protein property problems that she encountered,
some that were non-intuitive.
Talking with her, and other bench scientists, could be helpful.
They might also have datasets for ML exercises.

Next steps:

1. Walk through external datasets with Kannan. (Before end of year, next year.)
1. Next year, plan a patch GNN wrangling hack.
