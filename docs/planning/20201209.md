# Meeting notes

## In attendance

- Kannan
- Mei
- Eric

## Acomplished

- Kannan went through external Methionine oxidation datasets with Mei and Eric.
- Mei and Eric asked questions, to augment our own understanding of the data.

## Next Steps

- EM: will upload notes to Bitbucket, have Mei and Kannan approve it.
- EM: will schedule next call together, with a proposed workflow that we will have to build.

## Other related files

We have two data descriptor files (YAML format).
EM made up a schema,
inspired by [Frictionless Data][frictionlessdata].
We can always evolve it as we need.

As of 9 December 2020, the descriptor files are in:

- `./data/ghesquire_2011/datadescriptor.yaml`
- `./data/yang_2017/datadescriptor.yaml`

## Brainstorming for next meeting

- We need to hash out the analysis strategy/framework/something.
